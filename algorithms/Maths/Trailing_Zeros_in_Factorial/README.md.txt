# Trailing Zeros in Factorial

Given an integer n, find the number of trailing 0s in its factorial.
Do this without actually finding the n!, as the integer given can be large and its factorial can exceed the integer limits.

### Input Format

Integer n

### Output Format

Count of trailing 0s

### Constraints 

1 <= n <= 0^11

### Sample Input

```
50
```

### Sample Output

```
12
```
